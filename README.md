                        Online Learning and Convex Optimization Course                        

Welcome to the Online Learning and Convex Optimization course repository! In this repository,
you will find a collection of algorithms and practical implementations for online learning
algorithms and convex optimization techniques. Additionally, you will also find an exploration
of regret analysis methods, including FTL (Follow the Leader), OSD (Online Sub-Gradient
Descent), Mirror Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Follow the Regularized Leader, and more.


                                    What is Online Learning?

Online learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on sequential decision-making
problems where data arrives in a streaming fashion, and decisions must be made in real-time.
This differs from traditional batch learning, where the entire dataset is available from the
start. Online learning algorithms make predictions or decisions based on the current
information, and then learn from the feedback or rewards received.

Online learning algorithms are particularly useful in scenarios with large-scale, dynamic, or
continuously changing datasets. They are commonly used in applications such as online
advertising, recommendation systems, finance, and personalized medicine, among others.


                             Convex Optimization in Online Learning

Convex optimization is a fundamental mathematical framework used in online learning algorithms.
It provides tools and techniques for optimizing convex objective functions subject to
constraints. In the context of online learning, convex optimization is often crucial for
updating models or parameters in an efficient and effective manner.

Convex optimization allows us to solve a wide range of problems, including:

 • Linear and logistic regression
 • Support Vector Machines (SVM)
 • Elastic Net and LASSO regularization
 • Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 • Quadratic programming
 • And many more...


                                        Regret Analysis

Regret analysis is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of online learning
algorithms. It measures the difference between the algorithm's performance and the performance
of an optimal strategy that has access to complete offline knowledge.

By analyzing the regret, we can assess how well an online learning algorithm adapts to the
dynamic data environment and make comparisons to other algorithms. This analysis helps in
understanding the inherent trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, and in quantifying
the benefits of different algorithms under various scenarios.
